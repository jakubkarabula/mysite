# Hello, my name is Maya Karabula-Stysiak ðŸŒ±

I am working as a software developer and I am also doing some coding experiments in my free time.
I am also very passionate about ecology. This is why this website looks very raw. It's a part of small web movement emerging now in the Internet that brings attention to the impact the technology and current websites have on the environment, society and data ownership, there is also nostalgia for the early web.
I like to make my own tools, mainly software.
