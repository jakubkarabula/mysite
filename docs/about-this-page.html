<p>The Web is using way too many resources, it&#39;s better to make websites slimmer. You can find more on my opinion in this post:</p>
<p><a href="documents-were-not-supposed-to-be.html">~ üíõ 25.08.2022 - Documents were not supposed to be Turing complete</a></p>
<h3 id="tech-side">Tech side</h3>
<p>Following my take that most websites should be simple documents. I write this website as a set of Markdown documents that I convert with a script to HTML and Gemini format. For some spice, I add CSS and meta tags to it. Later on, I host the files with simple HTTP and Gemini servers.</p>
<p>This decision puts very specific restraints on what I can add and what not. But this is great for me, I can just sit down and write a post and publish it, I don&#39;t think too much about SEO, layout, videos, or ads. I use almost only text and images.</p>

<h3 id="nostalgia">Nostalgia</h3>
<p>I started making websites in the early 2000s. What I liked about the old Web were the communities that sprung up in different spaces, some were bound with real-world locality eg for Polish fans of some bands, and some were more international. I have met my first girlfriend this way, and a few friends as well. Back then I created a fan website with Microsoft Frontpage about a German rapper Sido and a Russian rapper Seryoga. It didn&#39;t make a lot of sense but who was there to stop me. I miss that mess.</p>
<h3 id="small-web">Small Web</h3>
<p>This nostalgia for the old messy Web brought me to the small Web. A community that lives on in these small spaces, outside of mainstream Internet. It&#39;s mostly still on the Web (although there is also Gemini which is running parallel to the Web), so it&#39;s easy to access. Come visit if you want.</p>
