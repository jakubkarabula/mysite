<p>In my day to day job I am working as a web developer. In most companies in Berlin that means working on a Mac. Which is not too bad, a lot of the terminal tools are available for macOS as well which is great. What is less great is that it&#39;s not so easy to replace window manager on the newer versions of macOS, but I don&#39;t want to say good bye to keyboard driven tiling window managers like i3 and bspwm. There are two main options that I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>To install for example bspwm one needs XQuartz, it&#39;s possible to set it up but then it works only with X11 apps, not native mac ones. I also could not get X11 apps to render properly on retina screens.</li>
<li>An alternative is to use apps that run alongside standard macOS window manager, things like Amethyst and Yabai. They modify the position and size of the windows, but they don&#39;t replace the management so it can be clunky and slow sometimes. I can however recommend Yabai as an ok option for daily use.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have another idea. It&#39;s a bit cursed but it&#39;s quite pleasant to work with so far. I spent most of my time working with Firefox, terminal and nvim/vscode, sometimes I need to also take a look at images. And i like keyboard driven flows, tiling window management etc. What if I would be able to have terminal, file management, image viewing etc inside Firefox, just as another tab? This is what I called JSWM, Javascript based window manager that is basically a web app with simple implementations of window management, key bindings and apps like terminal (with ttyd) and image viewing. Most of other things like editing and file browsing I can do via the terminal.</p>
