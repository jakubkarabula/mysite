<h2>Manifesto</h2>
<p>I live in an old tenement. But I love the flora that surrends me in central Europe. I love to go to the parks and forests. There is a clear separation of what is presented as the city part and what is the park part. I would love to engage with flora in an ecological and technological but less alien way, not as means or commodities, but as cohabitants. Living together, just like with cats, other plants and flies. I would like this project to be led by empathy and consideration, to modify the space progressively to fit all the persons inside and to grow with relationships. Therefore with more grounding and attention by definition it is not aiming to be easily scalable and I think it's not a wrong mindeset to adapt in the world of an 'infinite growth'. I want to invite the herbs, vegetable plants to be a part of my space as well, I hope they will like it. In any case welcome onboard.</p>

<p>It has been a while. I had a lot of work in my daily job. In this time the summer has passed. It is becoming cold outside. I have decided to go with Kratky method, it's a passive, deep water culture, hydroponic growth method. Primarily because it requires less space and initial setup. It is not very easy way, but I will monitor the health daily. I also plan to add a grow light and set it to light automatically for ~8 hours a day.</p>

<p>I think to extend usability of the sensor to record temperature in my living room where my cats live. The temperature there varies a lot between day and night and between individual days. I have noticed that my cats are sometimes cold in the morning. I want to be able to help them better and to achieve it I need to know what is the temperature at night. Perhaps connect an additional heater that will start only when the temperature drops below certain number. So basically a heater with a simple thermostat. I will run the temperature analysis through the night.</p>

<p>I have got a dht 22 via post. I connected it to rpi. It reads temperature and humidity correctly. 27 degrees Celsius, 52% humidity. It's exciting, my first experience with connecting something psychical to rpi. One year after using it mostly as an adblocker and server.</p>
