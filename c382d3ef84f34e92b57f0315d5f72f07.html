<p>I had this thought, being now on vacations in the centre Germany that here it makes sense to learn trees, birds, flowers and mushrooms. Because there are plenty, they are indeed a part of the village. Animals are casually going around the rented house.</p>
<p>Being a city girl that I am I get spooked by the noises of birds and animals being so close. When my wife and I were watching a tv series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2618986/">Wayward Pines</a> we heard noises. We were totally sure that one of the small fellows got into our living room. Long story short it didn’t, it must have been on a porch, but we have called the owner to help us check the property. 🙃  </p>
